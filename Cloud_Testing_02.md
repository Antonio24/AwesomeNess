> Cloud computing is an internet-based computing model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, 
> on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing 
> resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that can 
> be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort.
> 
> It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources.
> 
> It relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale, similar to a utility (like the electricity grid) over a network.
